Rather than a trip wire, this trap is wound with a small thread of the Weave itself. A savvy magician may be able to sense such a presence, or a perceptive adventurer may notice light bending as if by heat - but most likely, the party will fall victim to this trap!

When the Weavewire is detected, dispelled, or tripped, roll on the following table to determine effect and Dispel DC:


1d20 | Effect | Dispel Magic DC
-----|--------|----------------
20      | Teleport. Jackpot - your party (up to 8) teleports to the end of the dungeon facing the big bad! Survive this encounter and work your way back out ;) | DC 17
18-19      | Faerie Fire. The creature that trips the trap is outlined in Faerie Fire, and maybe there is faint laughter through the dungeon walls from the foe who placed this trap. Lucky you. If you want to make it effect multiple party members, up the level of the spell by +1 for each party member and increase the Dispel DC the same. | DC 11
15-17 | Greater Invisibility and [Mute](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/4015-mute)/Silence. The creature who triggers the Weavewire immediately becomes invisible and mute. Watch hilarity ensue as the rest of the party thinks they have lost their companion for a couple of minutes! | DC 13 saves vs. Mute, DC 14 for Greater Invisibility
12-14 | Irresistible Dance. Bust a move stranger - you can't resist the urge! | DC 16
11 | Polymorph. The creature who triggers the trip wire is polymorphed into a creature of the DM's choice. | DC 14
7-10  | Reverse Gravity. Every creature in a 50ft radius falls *to* the sky as though they had fallen *from* the sky. It's up to the DM to decide: is there a ceiling? Are there sharp spikes on the ceiling? Are there a bunch of toothy mouths waiting to devour the heroes? | DC 17
5-6   | Hypnotic Pattern. For extra flavor, have a minotaur or similar attack your charmed players. | DC 13
2-4   | Inflict Wounds, +6 to hit, 3d10 necrotic damage. Right before your chest, instantaneously, a black and necrotic arrow appears at speed and attempts to pierce your armor. The spell attack roll has Advantage. | DC 11
1       | Mirage Arcane. After the wire is triggered, the characters watch as the room around them warps and twists into a menacing situation: maybe tiles turn into spikes and grow upward, walls bow as if about to burst from water pressure, heavy stones fall from the ceiling and create a booming sound as they shatter - pieces seem to fall on the characters even! Maybe the stones look the same, but as the players walk through them, they feel soft and marshy like a swamp. For the next 10 days (!!!), they are left to determine whether what they are seeing and feeling is real or an illusion. This may send them running straight back out of this dungeon, telling insane stories to barkeeps in a nearby village. | DC 17

### Mechanics

#### Type

Magical. It behaves like a mechanical trip wire, but is magical in it's essence.

#### Triggering the Trap

Simply passing through it triggers the trap. Because of the magical nature of this trap, it can be placed just about anywhere. Like a tripwire, a doorway is a good place for it, but instead of being near the bottom toward the floor, it could be right in the middle of the frame. It could even be diagonal from top-left to bottom-right.

In order to avoid being tripped by wandering monsters, a Weavewire Trap in the doorway could have a path blocked by a locked door, which, when opened, exposes passer-bys to the trap.

Once the Weavewire is triggered, the trap disappears - the magical energy locked in the strand of the Weave has been expended.

#### Detecting the Trap

##### Wisdom (Perception) Check DC 23

This trap is unusually difficult for even an experienced rogue to detect. A character who rolls a DC 23 or greater Perception check notices what looks like the heat of a fire bending the light around it.

##### Intelligence (Arcana) Check DC 13

A mage who is familiar with the Weave may be able to see or feel a disturbance in the Weave here with relative ease.


#### Disabling the Trap

Dispel Magic DC varies depending on the effect. See effect table for details.

This magical trap cannot be disabled by mechanical means, such as Thieves Tools. If a character attempts to disarm by, for example, removing the frame of the door or breaking down the wall, the Weavewire remains magically bound in the location it is placed even without material to connect to.
