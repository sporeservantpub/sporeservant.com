*Note: this post was inspired by the article ["Dungeons and Dragons creatures, generated by neural network"](http://aiweirdness.com/post/172170729017/dungeons-and-dragons-creatures-generated-by), wherein [a savvy artificial intelligence wizard Janelle Shane](https://twitter.com/JanelleCShane) trained a [neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) to come up with a slew of new creature names based on 2nd edition AD&D creature names. I found these names inspiring and decided to render these creations storied and statted - hence, this post. Enjoy - use in your game, modify as necessary, and please let me know in the comments if you love/hate/have recommendations :) cheers!*

## Giant Fraithwarp

![A 'Fraithwarp']({{ "/images/fraithwarp.png" | absolute_url }})

*Large fey, chaotic good*

This giant, winged caterpillar is a woodland inhabitant that does its utmost not to be seen or heard by camouflaging into its woodland surroundings. Even more so, a Fraithwarp will begin to make the woods around it more like the Feywild the longer it is there.

A Fraithwarp, if stationed in one place long enough, can create a gate to the Feywild through which it can summon protectors, or, transport creatures to the Feywild.

It is most common to find them near Elven lands, as their primary function is to leave an open connection to the Feywild through which Fey creatures on other planes can return to defend the Feywild in times of need.

### Tactics

If a Fraithwarp has not been making its nest in a location for a long time (greater than a month), it will attempt to detect whether the party is good, and if not, flee at the first sign of danger. If it can't escape, it may use it's Lair Action to summon some weak Fey creatures to help it make an escape, or teleport.

However, a Fraithwarp who has been nesting in a location and begings to open its gate to the Feywild will defend its nest at all costs. It will likely start off a fight by casting entangle, and then charge at the first creature to pass through the web. At the end of the turn of the first creature who hits it, it will cast Shimmering Shield on itself for protection. Depending on the number of attackers, it will use it's Lair Action to summon one strong creature, or many weak creatures from the Feywild to protect it, and it will fight to the death.

*Charge*. If the Fraithwarp moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits with its horn attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

*Innate Spellcasting*. The Fraithwarp's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). The Fraithwarp can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

At will: detect evil and good, druidcraft, pass without trace

1/day each: calm emotions, dispel evil and good, entangle

**Magic Resistance**. The Fraithwarp has advantage on saving throws against spells or other magical effects.

**Magical Weapons**. The Fraithwarp's weapon attacks are magical.

### Actions

**Multiattack**. The Fraithwarp makes two attacks: one bite attack with it's proboscis, and one whip with it's antennae.

**Bite**. *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 +4) piercing damage.

**Whip**. *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

**Healing Touch (3/Day)**. The Fraithwarp touches another creature with it's proboscis. The target magicically regains 11 (2d8 + 2) hit points. In addition, the touch removes all diseases and neutralizes all poisons affecting the target.

**Teleport (1/Day)**. The Fraithwarp magically teleports itself and up to three willing creatures it can see within 5 feet of it, along with any equipment they are wearing or carrying, to a location the Fraithwarp is familiar with, up to 1 mile away.

### Legendary Actions

The Fraithwarp can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the otions below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Fraithwarp regains spent legendary actions at the start of it's turn.

**Bite**. The Fraithwarp makes one bite attack.

**Shimmering Shield (Costs 2 Actions)**. The Fraithwarp creates a shimmering, magical field around itself or another creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target gains a +2 bonus to AC until the end of the Fraithwarp's next turn.

### Lair Actions

On the first initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Fraithwarp can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects. A Fraithwarp's CR is not altered by it's lair, but the encounter itself will be more deadly as monsters may be summoned.

**Conjure Fey (1/day)**. The Fraithwarp casts Conjure Fey as a 6th level spell.

**Conjure Woodland Beings (1/day)**. The Fraithwarp casts Conjure Woodland Beings as a 4th level spell.
