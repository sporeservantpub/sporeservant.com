### Keith Rosenberg (author)

I started playing D&D in between the [release of 3.0 and 3.5][0] in order to escape the obvious apocolypse being brought upon us in the 2000s by boy bands. Luckily, the path I chose was righteous and I managed to survive (although, to be fair, Justin Timberlake is doing *much better*).

I was led into Forgotten Realms initially by very haphazardly picking up an R.A. Salvatore novel, [The Legacy][2], in a local Barnes and Noble in New Jersey. Previously, I was heavily into gothic fiction and some fantasy, but that book set me on a helluva journey! Eventually, I started playing 3rd edition with a couple of friends, and one day, they let me DM, and I'm pretty sure I have been a player maybe 3 total times since then :p [#DM4Life][3]

Aside from being very much in love with [5th edition][4] (side note: thank you [OSR][2] people for pushing Wizards to go back to the old school), I'm also a big fan of Goodman Games' DCCRPG (although I confess, I haven't played much since 5th edition came out). I am also a sucker for throwback/vintage art and maps (hence the use of Futura here on this site).
